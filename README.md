   - Utilize Langflow to manage the query processing workflow.
3. **Vector Similarity Search:**
   - Use Faiss or Pinecone to perform vector similarity searches to retrieve relevant data.
4. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Query the Zoho Catalyst Data Store using the extracted filters.
5. **User Response:**
   - Present the retrieved data in a user-friendly format.

### Step 6: Implement Data Storage Workflow Through Prompts

**Objective:** Allow users to store data using natural language prompts.

**Actions:**
1. **User Input Handling:**
   - Develop the interface for users to input natural language prompts for data storage.
2. **Data Parsing and Validation:**
   - Use the LLM to parse the prompt and extract structured data.
   - Utilize Langflow to manage the data parsing and validation workflow.
3. **Schema Mapping and Validation:**
   - Validate the extracted data against the target schema.
4. **Data Insertion:**
   - Store the validated data into the appropriate table in Zoho Catalyst.
5. **User Acknowledgment:**
   - Confirm successful data storage or provide error messages.

### Step 7: Implement File-Based Data Ingestion Workflow

**Objective:** Enable seamless data ingestion from files.

**Actions:**
1. **File Upload:**
   - Develop the interface for users to upload files (PDFs, CSVs, Excel sheets).
2. **File Processing:**
   - Implement file processing to extract relevant information.
   - Utilize Langflow to manage the file processing workflow.
3. **Schema Mapping and Validation:**
   - Map the extracted data to the target schema and validate it.
4. **Data Insertion:**
   - Store the validated data in the Zoho Catalyst Data Store.
5. **User Acknowledgment:**
   - Confirm successful ingestion or provide error details.

### Step 8: Implement Security Measures

**Objective:** Ensure the system is secure and compliant with data privacy regulations.

**Actions:**
