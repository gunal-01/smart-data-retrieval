# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Data Management Project

## **Overview**
This project integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Zoho Catalyst to create a highly scalable system for storing and retrieving data using natural language prompts. The system enables users to interact with data through AI-assisted features like file uploads (PDFs, CSVs, Excel) and direct natural language commands for storing and retrieving structured data.

## **Real-World Problems Solved**

1. **Efficient Data Retrieval**:
   - **Problem**: Businesses struggle with accessing specific information quickly from large datasets.
   - **Solution**: Using RAG, users can retrieve data in real time by asking natural language questions like:
     *"What is the sales performance of Product A in Q1 2024?"*

2. **Simplified Data Storage**:
   - **Problem**: Non-technical users find it hard to input structured data into a database.
   - **Solution**: Store data by prompting natural language commands:
     *"Add an employee named John Doe with ID 5678, position as Manager, and salary as $90,000."*

3. **Data Ingestion via Files**:
   - **Problem**: Manual entry of data from external files (PDFs, CSVs, etc.) is time-consuming.
   - **Solution**: Automate data ingestion and storage from file uploads to the database:
     - Upload a **CSV** containing employee records, and the system automatically updates the database.

4. **Scalable and Intelligent Systems**:
   - **Problem**: Scaling systems for high volumes of requests is challenging for small and medium businesses.
   - **Solution**: The project leverages scalable Zoho Catalyst APIs to handle diverse and concurrent requests efficiently.

## **Features**

### **Data Retrieval**
- Retrieve specific data using natural language queries.
- Integrates a **free open-source LLM** (Llama 3 via Ollama) to process queries and fetch relevant data.

### **Data Storage**
- Add structured data to the database via:
  1. Natural language prompts.
  2. File uploads (PDF, CSV, Excel).

### **Automation**
- Use scheduled triggers (cron jobs) for regular data updates.
- Utilize RAG to combine dynamic retrieval with database storage.

### **Scalability**
- Built using Zoho Catalyst's compute, orchestration, and storage tools.
- Supports high-volume, concurrent requests.

## **Project Workflow**

### **1. Data Retrieval Workflow**
1. **User Query**:
   - Example: *"Show me all employees hired in 2023."*
2. **Natural Language Processing**:
   - The LLM parses the query to identify intent and relevant entities.
3. **Data Store Interaction**:
   - Query Zoho Catalyst's relational data store or file store.
4. **Response Generation**:
   - Generate a natural language response with structured data.

### **2. Data Storage Workflow**
#### **Through Prompting**:
1. **User Input**:
   - Example: *"Add a product named Galaxy S23, ID 4321, category Electronics, price $999."*
2. **Data Parsing**:
   - Parse fields like `name`, `ID`, `category`, and `price`.
3. **Validation**:
   - Ensure the data matches the database schema.
4. **Database Update**:
   - Insert data into the appropriate table.

#### **Through File Uploads**:
1. **User Action**:
   - Upload a file (e.g., employee_records.csv).
2. **File Parsing**:
   - Parse the file into structured fields.
3. **Validation**:
   - Check each record for schema compliance.
4. **Database Update**:
   - Insert parsed data into the Zoho Catalyst database.

## **Examples**

### **Data Retrieval**
- **Query**: *"What is the salary of employee ID 1234?"*
- **Response**: *"The salary of employee ID 1234 is $80,000."*

### **Data Storage**
- **Prompt-Based**:
  - *"Add an employee named Alice Brown, ID 8901, position Software Engineer, salary $120,000."*
- **File-Based**:
  - Upload a CSV:
    | ID   | Name         | Position           | Salary   |
    |------|--------------|--------------------|----------|
    | 8901 | Alice Brown  | Software Engineer  | $120,000 |

### **Automated Retrieval and Storage**
- Schedule daily retrieval of sales reports from the database.
- Automate ingestion of Excel files containing updated inventory data.

## **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Technology Stack**
- **Zoho Catalyst**:
  - Relational Data Store for structured data storage.
  - File Store for file uploads (PDF, CSV, Excel).
  - Advanced I/O functions for API endpoints.
- **Ollama** for local Llama 3 model serving.
- **LangChain** for building RAG pipelines.

### **Key Modules**
1. **Data Parsing**:
   - Use tools like `pandas` for file processing.
   - Leverage **LangChain** for natural language prompt parsing.
2. **Database Interactions**:
   - Relational database operations via Zoho Catalyst SDK.
3. **LLM Integration**:
   - Process queries with the Llama 3 model.
4. **File Handling**:
   - Handle PDF/Excel ingestion with libraries like PyPDF2 or OpenPyXL.

## **Scalability and Performance**
- **Caching**:
  - Use Zoho Catalyst Cache for frequently accessed data.
- **Cron Jobs**:
  - Automate periodic data updates.
- **Load Balancing**:
  - Scale compute functions to handle concurrent user requests.

## **Future Enhancements**
1. Integrate advanced LLMs for more accurate query parsing.
2. Add support for additional file formats (e.g., JSON, XML).
3. Implement role-based access control for sensitive data retrieval.
4. Provide analytics dashboards for user insights.
